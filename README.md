BankGuard AI

BankGuard AI is a behavior-based continuous authentication system for mobile banking.
It enhances app security by analyzing user interaction patterns (typing speed, touch pressure, navigation behavior, device orientation) in real time — using on-device ML (TensorFlow Lite) to detect anomalies and trigger adaptive security actions like FaceID or OTP.
